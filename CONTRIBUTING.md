Hello, this is temporary but some basic guidelines for now:

1) Open an issue before starting work on a PR - and comment on an issue if you are starting to work on something
2) Don't PR to main. We will create branches for new features.
3) Use the latest StyLua for formatting. Luau lsp for types. These will be clarified in a wally.toml and aftman.toml later.
4) Strict typing where possible please.
5) Please work with git/rojo and follow good commit practices
6) Be nice and patient
7) I'd suggest looking at Fusion's contributing file because it's good
