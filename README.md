# Background

In 2019, I created a simple tool aimed at creating railway tracks using Bezier Curves for Roblox games called "Electrified Track Placer". Unfortunately, this game project came to an end, but I released much of my source code to the community in an effort to help put my code to a use - and lots of people have found my work useful in implementing CFrame-based. However, that module contained an rbxm, which was this plugin, and it's turned out to be the most widely used part of the code I released!

5 years later, more, better bezier-curved based plugins exist. In fact, I don't even think bezier curves are the best answer to this problem. There are many problems with the plugin too, like the messy "Path" folders it makes and a disturbingly high crash rate. However, lots of people are still having to resort to using my buggy creation due to the features it offers, and some have made their own modifications! Also, the open source community has come a long way.

I am giving this plugin its own repository so we can work on this together, properly manage the project with git a

# What's next

This needs to be converted from an rbxm file to a proper git repository that works with rojo, wally, etc. After that, we'll start working on anything else in Issues. I also want to move away from the name "Electrified Track Placer", since people have been using this for all sorts (I've seen people placing fences, and even weirder things).

# Getting involved

We are still in the planning phase. Feel free to make an Issue if you want to open a discussion topic. Once we start contributing there will be guidelines etc, and possibly a thread in the OSS server. Contact me - I can add you to a discord group!
